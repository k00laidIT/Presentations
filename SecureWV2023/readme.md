## Abstract
Organizations rely more on technology and computer systems than they ever have before, which is why they’re also a target for cyber criminals. It’s critical to create a comprehensive, layered approach to security so that you can make sure your applications and data are always running, accessible, and protected. 
But where do you start? During this session we’ll discuss:
- What ransomware looks like in 2023
- Best practices for monitoring and protecting production workloads
- How to defend against ransomware, data leakage, and other threats
- Why a robust security and data protection plan that includes disaster recovery is essential
