## Abstract
When we hear Cybersecurity we often think about preventing attacks against our production systems and data but in 2025 the reality is we need to be inclusive when we think about topics such as BCDR (Backup Continuity/Disaster Recovery) in our information security practices and policies. This can mean things as simple as protecting backup files to integrating continuity testing into your ransomware response playbook. In this session we'll cover how BCDR decisions can play into your Cybersecurity mindset and provide some best practices towards integration.
